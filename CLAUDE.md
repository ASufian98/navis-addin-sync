# Project Instructions

## Post-Build Deployment

After every successful build, prompt the user to deploy the DLL to Navisworks (only DLL needed, not XAML):

```
copy "D:\navis-addin-sync\bin\Debug\net48\NavisWebAppSync.dll" "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Navisworks Manage 2026\Plugins\NavisWebAppSync\"
```
